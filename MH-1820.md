# ThermostatBecaWifi MH-1820

This is a fork off https://github.com/klausahrenberg/WThermostatBeca/ to support my Tuya compatible MH-1820 wifi thermostats. CAVE: those originally use a WBR3 Module (RTL8720) which is incompatible with the ESP8266 firmware, so I replaced it with an ESP-07 (pin compatible). Unsoldering worked reasonably well with a hot air gun (pics on request).

I got most of the DPs via tuya-mqtt after obtaining their "secrets" from the cloud by installing the Smart Life App, creating a Tuya IoT dev account, linking this to the Smart Life App, and pulling the secrets via tinytuya wizard from the cloud. The MCU speaks Tuya serial protocol version 3.

DPS List:


1 on/off

2 manual/program/holiday (holiday -> 32: days remaining)


3 start/stop (heater relay)


5 lock


9 antifreeze


18 sensor in/out/in_out

19 c/f


22 desired temp


32 undefined/number of holidays left

33 sensor in in o C * 10


35 t comp in sensor


36 wifi signal strength request/info


37 sensor in in F * 10


39 working day mode 6_1/5_2/7


42 programming string in base64 e. g. AAYCxgAIAk4eCwJOHgwCTgARAsYAFgJOAAgCxgAXAk4=

43 wifi request/info


101: floor temp in C * 10

102: floor temp in F * 10

103 t comp out sensor

104 t slewing (hysteresis?)

105 power on/off on lock (power/no_power)

106: 35 ???

107: 96 ???


With fashbergs firmware I managed to try out some of the commands.


In the current version, it publishes some of the data via MQTT: deviceOn, relay, actualTemperature, actualFloorTemperature, targetTemperature
